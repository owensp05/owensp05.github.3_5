   <h1>Owens Nostalgic Cookie Experience</h1>
   
   <h2>My name is Patricia Owens</h2>
 	<p>Before becoming a business analyst for my sisterâ€™s cookie company(<em>Owens Nostalgic Cookie Experience</em>), I worked in  	Clinical Research where there is often travel and a lot of time away from family.  During the Christmas Holiday I always looked 	forward to the nostalgic times we had as kids while eating the cookies at home that were made by our grandmother.  My 	grandmother passed down the recipe and process for making the cookies to my sister.</p>
	
	<p>My sister began to make cookies for my family and extended family during the holidays.  Once I started attending holiday 	     	parties for so many different groups where I joined, my sister would always make more than we needed, so I could give cookies to 	my friends, co-workers and any group or organization where I attended Christmas parties.</p>
	
	<p>After a while, my sister started getting requests for cookies during the holidays and people began to pay her for them.  Since 	cookie orders have begun to increase over the years, we decided to start a cookie business and dedicate the holiday time to 	encouraging people to spend time on the nostalgic experience that our family has enjoyed for more than 50 years.  Come home, share 	and eat!</p>
